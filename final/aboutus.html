              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                In 1956 our grandparents, Rudy and Emily, met and fell in love
                at the Pacific Coast. Rudy and Emily eventually married and
                after saving all their earnings, built the Pacific Coast Resort
                to share their love of nature with others. <br /><br />The
                Pacific Coast Resort offers many fun activities, allowing guests
                from all walks of life to unplug from their busy lives, relax,
                and get in tune with mother earth. Whether you are traveling
                alone, with a partner, or in a group, we activities for all.
